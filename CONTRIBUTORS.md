## ü§ñ AI Assistance

This project was developed with assistance from AI (Claude), which provided:
- Static program analysis insights
- Optimization suggestions and techniques
- Code review and bug detection
- Performance improvement recommendations
- Documentation and example generation

**Note**: All final implementation decisions, architectural choices, and code quality standards were determined by Po Shih Tsang. The AI assistance enhanced the development process but did not make autonomous code decisions.
